    <p class="bg-primary">Feature Selection in Economic Predictive Analytics</p>
    <p class="bg-success">The objective of this project is to explore feature selection techniques for economic predictive analytics. Feature selection is the process of choosing
    the best subset from the available features. The features are data attributes used to build predictive models.</p>
    <p class="bg-info">In the problem of predicting economic performance, as in all predictive problems, the issue of deciding which features to use in model building is
    critical. This is true because some features are much better than others in predicting a given target variable, so in order to yield the best prediction,
    the most effective features must be discovered. Also, eliminating features that are not predictive prevents overfitting in the model, makes the model
    easier to interpret, and makes the model computationally economical.</p>
	<p class="bg-info">The reason for selecting the economic domain to investigate feature selection is a) there a large number of datasets available containing economic
    measurements and b) there are many other datasets which, while not directly measuring economic activity, describe activities that influence or are
    influenced by overall economic trends; that is, these other datasets measure phenomena that are related to the economy.</p>

	<p class="bg-warning">Questions of interest include:  What are some methods for selecting features and what are their advantages and disadvantages; which methods are easiest to use; what is the range of
    effectiveness between methods; how do methods respond to dimension size?   What are some methods for selecting features and what are their advantages and disadvantages; which methods are easiest to use; what is the range of

    <p class="bg-warning">Examples of Analyses for Feature Selection:<br>
	    - Filter methods<br>
	    - Embedded methods<br>
	    - Wrapper methods<br>
		- Alternative methods, for example:<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp	· Domain models<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp	· Causality metrics, e.g. Granger causality test<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp	· Ensemble methods<br>
	<p class="bg-danger">Visualizations will facilitate comparisons between feature selection methods.</p>
