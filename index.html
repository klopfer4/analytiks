    <p class="bg-primary">Feature Selection in Economic Predictive Analytics</p>
    <p class="bg-success">The objective of this project has been to explore feature selection techniques for economic predictive analytics. Feature selection is the process of choosing
    the best subset from the available features. The features are data attributes used to build predictive models.</p>
    <p class="bg-info"><p>Feature Selection Method Summary<br />
Domain Based Criteria<br />
Which is more predictive: Time-Series from a balanced set of series (Money, Banking, &amp; Finance, Population, Employment, &amp; Labor Markets, National Accounts, Production &amp; Business Activity, Prices, International Data) versus selecting time-series all from one category.<br />
Normalized data versus raw data: which offers more accuracy? <br />
The normalization methods considered are:<br />
Min-Max normalization<br />
Decimal scaling<br />
Aggregation <br />
Predicting over an aggregated data set is more economical that over the pre-aggregated set. Is the relative accuracy between aggregated and raw feature sets the same?<br />
Data Transformations<br />
Does a log transformation improve the accuracy of a predictor?<br />
Information Theoretic measures<br />
Granger Causality</p>
	<p class="bg-warning">Questions of interest include:  What are some methods for selecting features and what are their advantages and disadvantages; which methods are easiest to use; what is the range of
    effectiveness between methods; how do methods respond to dimension size?   What are some methods for selecting features and what are their advantages and disadvantages; which methods are easiest to use; what is the range of
    effectiveness between methods; how do methods respond to dimension size?</p>
    <p class="bg-warning"><p>Machine Learning Method Summary<br />
The following machine learning methods were employed with the feature selection methods:<br />
Random Forests<br />
Boosting <br />
Bagging<br />
Support Vector Machines<br />
Multinomial Regression</p>
	<p class="bg-danger">Visualizations will facilitate comparisons between feature selection methods.</p>
