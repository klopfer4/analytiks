Feature selection is the process of choosing the best subset from    the available features. The features are data attributes used to build predictive models.</p>    <p class="bg-info">In the problem of predicting economic performance, as in all predictive problems, the issue of deciding which features to use in model building is critical. This is true    because some features are much better than others in predicting a given target variable, so in order to yield the best prediction, the most effective features must be discovered. Also,    eliminating features that are not predictive prevents overfitting in the model, makes the model easier to interpret, and makes the model computationally economical.</p>    <p class="bg-info"><img width="760" height="367" alt="" src="ts10.png" border="0"></p>    <p class="bg-info">In the above set of time-series, RPI (Real Personal Income) is the dependent variable and the other series are some of those that have been used as explanatory variables.</p>    <p class="bg-info">The most common type of time-series prediction is that using univariate time series models; for example, ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Averages).&nbsp;&nbsp; These    types of forecasting methods look only at one time-series and predict its future from its past.&nbsp;</p>    <p class="bg-info">Our hypothesis is that other time series can be used to inform the direction of the response time series in focus.&nbsp; After all, the economy is a system and to assess its    state requires multiple readings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as a doctor cannot take one measure of a patient, like body temperature or heart rate, and assess that state of that patients health, one    measure of the economy cannot portray the state of the economy as well as several indicators.</p>    <p class="bg-info"><font size="4">A Hypothesis:</font></p>    <p class="bg-info"><font size="4">Economic time-series forecasts are improved by including other economic time series as explanatory variables.</font></p>  </div>  <div class="container">    <font size="4">Exploring the hypothesis:&nbsp;
